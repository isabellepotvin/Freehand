# Freehand

Freehand was developped as part of a Design Studio course where the students were put into teams of four and were tasked to create a  large-scale multimedia product. Freehand was a four month long project that consisted of project & team management, research and design, product design & development, marketing and more. Throughout the term, my team delivered weekly project updates, a project proposal, a project pitch presentation, a design document, and an alpha prototype, as well as delivered and presented the final product. 


## Roles and Responsibilities 

Early on, my team members and I discussed each of our strengths and decided on roles for one another. Some of these roles included Project Manager, Brand Designer, Graphic Designer, UX/UI Designer, Software Developer and Marketing Lead. I stepped into the roles of Project Manager and Software Designer.

As the Project Manager, my responsibilities included: 
- leading weekly update meetings
- setting targets and monitoring progress (using KanBan board)
- ensuring quality and on-time delivery of the project

As the Software Developer, my responsibilities included:
- developing the application
- implementing Google's Firebase to work with the application
- uploading the application to the Google Play Store
- marking up all documentation related to the apps functionality and features


## About Freehand

Freehand is a social media platform that allows passionate artists to connect through what they
love most; art. The app allows you to connect with artists from around the world online, creating
the potential of meeting new people that have similar interests to yours. The interesting aspect of
this app is that the main form of communication is through art, thus creating a unique type of
relationship. Our goal is to provide users with an app that allows them to have fun, pass time, and
utilize their creativity. We would like to see artists from around the world meet and socialize on our
app. We want to transcend any language barriers and, through drawings, essentially provide people
with a new language to use.

There were a series of steps we followed to successfully develop Freehand. Throughout this project
we have followed a design and development process and have marketed our app using various
platforms. We have also launched our application on the Google Play Store so that people can
download it to their Android device for free.
